I am using notes.txt within my hobbingbroach repo to get github started!

I want to publish to branches to make this more real like I'm in a team, so
I'm going to have good notes to do so here from my other notes in 
--git-tutorial / help3branchingmerging.txt

Making branches
1. cd to your project name folder.
2. git branch 'branch-name'
3. Check that it made it with... git log --all --graph
3a. You'll see an arrow pointing to main, bc we are in the main branch.
4. Switch to the branch with git checkout 'branch-name'
4a. Arrow should be pointing to new branch now.
5. We can make commits on this branch. 
6. I recommend going to my notes in github below.....
6b. There, I detail doing branches as a workflow with github
like I'm on a team.

check git-tutorial / help3branchingmerging.txt for deleting unwanted commits.
