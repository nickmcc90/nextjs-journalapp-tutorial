I am using notes.txt within my hobbingbroach repo to get github started!

I want to publish to branches to make this more real like I'm in a team, so
I'm going to have good notes to do so here from my other notes in 
--git-tutorial / help3branchingmerging.txt

Making branches
1. cd to your project name folder.
2. git branch 'branch-name'
3. Check that it made it with... git log --all --graph
3a. You'll see an arrow pointing to main, bc we are in the main branch.
4. Switch to the branch with git checkout 'branch-name'
4a. Arrow should be pointing to new branch now.
5. We can make commits on this branch. 
***
check git-tutorial / help3branchingmerging.txt for deleting unwanted commits.
***
6. git add . a new commit to this branch
7. git log to see it worked
8. git push origin 'branch-name' to push branch commits to repo
9. Then we go to github and the repo, and click the green pull req button.
10. Make a detailed comment explaining what's been done in the work
11. Merge the pull req in github.
11a. You can delete the branch now.
12. Sync these changes into local.
13. If you are in the branch in the terminal, that's fine. Type...
13b. git fetch 
13c. git log --all --graph
to see changes from remote.
14. Switch to branch and type git pull origin main

(I just made a new branch for the next batch of notes below)
Right now we are in a 'actual-init-app' branch.

Starting up next.js app environment
1. In vs code terminal, write npx create-next-app@latest
   1a. Press enter
   1b. Go through the instructions.. for this app...
   1c. Make a random name. (we will move everything out of this folder into our
      current folder anyway)
   1d. Choose no typescript, yes eslint, yes react compiler, yes tailwind, no src/, yes app
      router, no import alias.
2. npm run dev

3. Delete everything inside the return statement in page.js
4. Have in the rules to warn you when variables aren't used.
   4a. Go to eslintrc.json and put 
      {
       "rules": : {
         "no-unused-vars": ["warn"]
       }
      }
   4b. Little weird. I don't have a eslintrc.json file.
5. Now it's time to install shadcn. What does it do?
   5a. It has prebuilt components for us to use.
   5b. Go to shadcn.com
   5c.
