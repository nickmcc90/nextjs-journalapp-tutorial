I am using notes.txt within my hobbingbroach repo to get github started!

I want to publish to branches to make this more real like I'm in a team, so
I'm going to have good notes to do so here from my other notes in 
--git-tutorial / help3branchingmerging.txt

Making branches
1. cd to your project name folder.
2. git branch 'branch-name'
3. Check that it made it with... git log --all --graph
3a. You'll see an arrow pointing to main, bc we are in the main branch.
4. Switch to the branch with git checkout 'branch-name'
4a. Arrow should be pointing to new branch now.
5. We can make commits on this branch. 
***
check git-tutorial / help3branchingmerging.txt for deleting unwanted commits.
***
6. git add . a new commit to this branch
7. git log to see it worked
8. git push origin 'branch-name' to push branch commits to repo
9. Then we go to github and the repo, and click the green pull req button.
10. Make a detailed comment explaining what's been done in the work
11. Merge the pull req in github.
11a. You can delete the branch now.
12. Sync these changes into local.
13. If you are in the branch in the terminal, that's fine. Type...
13b. git fetch 
13c. git log --all --graph
to see changes from remote.
14. Switch to branch and type git pull origin main
