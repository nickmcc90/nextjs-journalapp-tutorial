I am using notes.txt within my hobbingbroach repo to get github started!

I want to publish to branches to make this more real like I'm in a team, so
I'm going to have good notes to do so here from my other notes in 
--git-tutorial / help3branchingmerging.txt

Making branches
1. cd to your project name folder.
2. git branch 'branch-name'
3. Check that it made it with... git log --all --graph
3a. You'll see an arrow pointing to main, bc we are in the main branch.
4. Switch to the branch with git checkout 'branch-name'
4a. Arrow should be pointing to new branch now.
5. We can make commits on this branch. 
***
check git-tutorial / help3branchingmerging.txt for deleting unwanted commits.
***
6. git add . a new commit to this branch
7. git log to see it worked
8. git push origin 'branch-name' to push branch commits to repo
9. Then we go to github and the repo, and click the green pull req button.
10. Make a detailed comment explaining what's been done in the work
11. Merge the pull req in github.
11a. You can delete the branch now.
12. Sync these changes into local.
13. If you are in the branch in the terminal, that's fine. Type...
13b. git fetch 
13c. git log --all --graph
to see changes from remote.
14. Switch to branch and type git pull origin main

(I just made a new branch for the next batch of notes below)
Right now we are in a 'actual-init-app' branch.

Starting up next.js app environment
1. In vs code terminal, write npx create-next-app@latest
   1a. Press enter
   1b. Go through the instructions.. for this app...
   1c. Make a random name. (we will move everything out of this folder into our
      current folder anyway)
   1d. Choose no typescript, yes eslint, yes react compiler, yes tailwind, no src/, yes app
      router, no import alias.
2. npm run dev
<timestamp: 7:33>
3. Delete everything inside the return statement in page.js
4. Have in the rules to warn you when variables aren't used.
   4a. Go to eslintrc.json and put 
      {
       "rules": : {
         "no-unused-vars": ["warn"]
       }
      }
   4b. Little weird. I don't have a eslintrc.json file.
5. Now it's time to install shadcn. What does it do?
   5a. It has prebuilt components for us to use.
   5b. Go to shadcn.com
   5c. Get started -> installation -> next.js
   5d. Follow the directions (go to the npm code option). Requires vs code terminal.
   5e. Shadcn is installed. You'll see a new 'lib' folder.
<timestamp: 8:50>
6. Let's try to add a button. We need to run the code from the directions in
the terminal, then copy paste some code from the directions into page.js.
   6a. You'll see a new 'components' folder get installed when you run the 
   code from the shadcn directions for a button.
   6b. Go to page.js and paste the component code. It's basically just an import
   statement at the top, with custom tag capitalization usage <Button></Button>
7. If you look inside button.jsx, you'll see it just uses tailwindCSS to get different
variants. Pretty cool. You can create your own custom variants here.
8. Let's make a custom one.
   8a. Make a 'journal: bg-orange-600 hover:bg-orange-700 text-white shadow' inside the
   'variant' which is inside the 'variants' object.
<timestamp: 12:14>
9. Add the 'journal' variant to your button tag using tailwind text.
   9a. <Button variant='journal'></Button>
10. Let's install a couple more components so we don't have to install
them later.
   10a. Type in vs code terminal npx shadcn@latest add accordion alert-dialog badge
   calendar card carousel dialog input popover skeleton sonner textarea
   10b. Things will install.
   10c. Don't override anything if you spawn in a component you already made.

QUICK NEXT.JS LESSON
<----------->

In layout.js, our entire app exists within the {children} area. {children} is wrapped in styling
all around it in the layout.js area.

<********************************>

11. Within layout.js, you can change the metadata to our project name and stuff, and you
can import fonts. Just delete the fonts in the layout.js 
and import a new one.
   11a. He imported a new one with the langauge:
   import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'

   const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] })
12. After that, this guy adds a header tag and a single div tag to the layout.js.
He likes proper semantics.
   12a. <body className={`${inter.className}`}>
        <div />
        <header></header>
          <main>{children}</main>
        </body>
   12b. I don't really get the {``} stuff there in 12a.
13. Delete the .svg images in the public folder, we don't need them. We can
grab our own images. Go grab a background and save it in the public folder. Grab
a logo too.
14. We can make this our background by modifying the single div we made in step 12a
with tailwindcss.
   14a. <div className="bg-[url('/chill-bg.jpeg')] opacity-50 fixed -z-10 inset-0 bg-cover" />
   14b. The -z sets the bg to be behind everything else.
   14c. Inset-0 acts like a top-0 bottom-0 left-0 and right-0 all in one.
   14d. Don't use the same "" '' to wrap the tailwindcss. Use different ones.
   14e. bg-cover allows your image to cover the whole bg proportionally to your screen.
<timestamp: 16:51. We are about to add a footer to the page.
15. Underneath the <main></main>, we will put a footer.
   15a. <footer className='bg-purple-300 py-12 opacity-10'>
          <div>
            <p>Made with love by Nick M.</p>
          </div>
        </footer> 
   15b. Adding 'min-h-screen' to the main tag will put this footer to the bottom instantly.
   15c. We want our footer text to be in the center, so we put tailwind on the div in our footer
   like so...
        <div className='mx-auto px-4 text-center text-gray-900></div>
   15d. The mx-auto is to have the div be in the middle. Putting the text in the middle is done
   by text-center.
